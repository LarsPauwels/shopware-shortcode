# Shortcodes in Shopware 6

Use Wordpress like Shortcodes within the Text Editor in Shopware 6.

### Configuration

After the plugin installation, you are now able to use these two shortcodes from within the Shopware Editor or CMS page as well.

* `{{ product=firstProductId,secondProductId }}`
* `{{ category=firstCategoryId,secondCategoryId }}`

*We're currently working on more Shortcodes, like for example to have the ability to create columns with Shortcodes.*
